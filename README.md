# 🐍 Python Piscine

This repository contains the codebase for the **Python Piscine**. An intensive curriculum designed to facilitate the transition from **low-level C programming** to modern **Python** (3.10+).

The primary goal of this project was to shift Procedural Programming to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, Pythonic best practices, and robust software architecture.

## Modules Overview

The Piscine is divided into 11 modules, progressing from syntax fundamentals to advanced design patterns:

* **Module 00 - Fundamentals:** Transitioning logic from C to Python (syntax, recursion, types).
* **Module 01 - OOP Basics:** Introduction to Classes, Objects, and Encapsulation.
* **Module 02 - Robustness:** Exception handling, custom errors, and fault-tolerant pipelines.
* **Module 03 - Collections:** Mastering Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, and Generators for data engineering.
* **Module 04 - Persistence:** File I/O operations, usage of context managers and RAII.
* **Module 05 - Polymorphism:** Method overriding and flexible data flow design.
* **Module 06 - Package Management:** Understanding Imports, Circular Dependencies, and `__init__.py`.
* **Module 07 - Advanced OOP:** Abstract Base Classes (ABC), Interfaces, and Multiple Inheritance.
* **Module 08 - Environments:** Virtual environments, `pip`, and project configuration.
* **Module 09 - Data Validation:** Creating robust data models using **Pydantic**.
* **Module 10 - Functional Programming:** Decorators, Lambda functions, and High-order functions.
